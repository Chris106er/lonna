## Lonna

Experimental FRP library for Graphical User Interfaces. Used in my [Harmaja](https://github.com/raimohanska/harmaja) project.

I have written this library to be more suitable than [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/) for my current UI programming needs. For context, I am the original author of the Bacon.js library so well so I know its limitations intimately.

Some day there may be a proper README, API docs and Tutorials for Lonna, but at the moment, this readme and the test cases in the [src]Â folder is all there is. Sorry for that! Help appreciated.

## Tutorial

I assume you can read TypeScript, which I'm using the examples and which also is the native language of Lonna. 
For clarity, I'll be using a lot of explicit types, while in practice TypeScript can infer a lot of them for you.

As the Tutorial here is quite incomplete, I urge you to check out [Harmaja Readme](https://github.com/raimohanska/harmaja) for applied usage of Lonna.

### Atoms

If I think about application state, the first thing that comes to my mind is one ore more mutable variables. You manipulate the value of a variable and then you'll want your UI to reflect this change. For instance, for a value of type `A`, a simple mutable variable of type `var a:A;` alone won't do, because you'll need a mechanism of informing your UI about the changes to the variable when someone assigns a new value like `a=new A();`. Hence, Atom, which in a simplified form looks like this:

```typescript
type Atom<A> = {
    set(newValue: A): void;
    get(): A;
    update(modification: (oldValue: A) => A);
    forEach(callback: (newValue: A) => void;
}
```

You can use an Atom like this.

```typescript
import * as L from "lonna";
type Person = {
    nick: string,
    name: string
}
type State = {
    user: Person;
    friends: Person[]
}
const state: L.Atom<State> = L.atom<State>({ user: { nick: "raimohanska", name: "Juha" }, friends: [] });
state.get() // returns current state
state.set({ user: { nick: "raimohanska", name: "Juha" }, friends: [{ nick: "akheron", name: "Petri" }] });
state.forEach((s : State) => {
    // render your UI here
    // This callback is called immediately for the initial value,
    // as well as each time the value changes.
})
```

### Decomposing State with Views

Application UIs tend to be built from components. In a component you are like to be dealing with some "slice" of the application's state and often would prefer to have abstractions that expose only the desired part of application state
to your component. With Lonna Atoms, you can create a *view* into your state to gain a read-write
`Atom` representing a state slice. In the previous example the way I updated `friends` was clumsy in the way that I had to
replace the whole atom state instead of dealing with friends only. Instead I can do

```typescript
const friends: L.Atom<Person[]> = L.view(state, "friends"); // Yes, this is fully type-safe even though using a string.
friends.set([{ nick: "akheron", name: "Petri" }])
```

When I create a view to an Atom, I get another read-write Atom that reflects a part of the original Atom's state.
When I set a new value to the view Atom, the original Atom's value will be replaced.

In addition to field names as strings, numeric indices can be used to access array elements:

```typescript
const bestFriend: L.Atom<Person> = L.view(friends, 0);
const bestFriendName: L.Atom<string> = L.view(bestFriend, "name")
const currentValueOfName: string = bestFriendName.get()
```

For advanced read-write views into data, you can replace string keys and numeric indices with *Lenses* as defined in [Lens.ts](https://github.com/raimohanska/lonna/blob/master/src/lens.ts). [Optics-ts Lenses and Isomorphisms](https://github.com/akheron/optics-ts) are also supported out of the box.

### Read-only views for calculated values

Sometimes you may want to have a *calculated value* that depends on one or more of other dynamic values. You'll of course
want to be able to observe changes to this value and reflect it in your UI just like with Atom. You can do also this
with `L.view` by proving a function like this:

```typescript
const friends: L.Atom<Person[]>;
const numberOfFriends: L.Property<number> = L.view(friends, f => f.length);
```

The type of these read-only calculated values is `Property` which is like an `Atom` but lacks the `set` and `modify` methods. In fact, [`Atom<A> extends Property<A>`](https://github.com/raimohanska/lonna/blob/master/src/abstractions.ts#L166). Just like with Atoms, you can react to changes in a Property using `forEach`:

```typescript
numberOfFriends.forEach(n => console.log(`You have ${n} friends.`));
```

Duplicate values are automatically skipped, so if the contents of the `friends` array above changes but the length remains the
same, your side-effects are not run for these duplicate values. 

You can also create calculated values based on multiple `Atoms` or `Properties`:

```typescript
const friends: L.Property<Person[]>;
const myName: L.Property<string>;
const namesakes: L.Property<Person[]> = L.view(myName, friends, (n, fs) => {
    return fs.filter(f => f.name === n)
})
```

The views that are based on multiple inputs are, of course, updated when any of the inputs is changed. Then your "combinator function" is run for the new values. 

Duplicates in the result value are skipped just like for any Properties and Atoms. Lonna checks for equality using `===` internally. If you want to skip duplicates with a custom equality operator, such as deep equality, you can do so by using [`skipDuplicates`](https://github.com/raimohanska/lonna/blob/master/src/skipDuplicates.ts) like `value.pipe(T.skipDuplicates(equals))` assuming you had [equals](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#equals) imported from from Ramda.


### Stateful views and Lifetimes

TODO

### Values based on external events

You can use Lonna Properties to represent all kinds of state. Not just "application state" but also, for instance, cursor position, window scroll position, WebSocket connection status. Anything that has a current value, can change, and needs to be observed. Then you can view, transform and combine these values just like all other Properties.

Here's how to get the [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) vertical scroll position "scrollY" as
an observable Property:

```typescript
const scrollPos: L.Property<number> = L.fromEvent(window, "scroll")
    .pipe(L.toStatelessProperty(() => Math.floor(window.scrollY)))

```

To break this down a bit, we start with `L.fromEvent(window, "scroll")` which gives us an `L.EventStream` that represents the 
Window "scroll" events as an observable stream. See EventStream chapter. Then we use `L.toStatelessProperty` which creates a
Property that's updated each time an event occurs in the given EventStream and gets it's current value using the given function. In this case the value is got from `window.scrollY`.

### Optimizing

By default, Lonna views into Properties and Atoms are stateless. In practice this means that whenever the value is accessed using `get` or in a `forEach` or `onChange` callback, the value is calculated using whatever mapping/combinator functions you've provided in your `L.view` calls. IMO this is generally a good strategy in the sense that it guarantees that the values are always fresh (no cached stale values). However, if there are any expensive computations in the chain, you may want to optimize. This can be done using [`cached`](https://github.com/raimohanska/lonna/blob/master/src/cached.ts) like so.


```typescript
const v: L.Property<A>;
const vCached: L.Property<A> = v.pipe(L.cached<A>(scope));
```

Caching is of course stateful so you'll need to provide a Scope to get a Property, as above. Without a Scope you'll get a `PropertySeed` which can be later scoped into a `Property` as described in the Stateful views and Lifetimes chapter.

## Differences to Bacon.js

Here are the essential differences to Bacon.js.

- Stateful Properties and EventStreams have an explicit `scope` which guarantees that they stay up-to-date for the required period. Scope can be global (active forever) or more limited, such as a GUI component lifetime. Access outside the explicit scope will cause thrown Errors.
- `EventStreamSeed` and `PropertySeed` abstractions for streams and properties that don't have a `scope`. These can be mapped, filtered etc, but need to be scoped before accessing the value. They are very lightweight which may prove to be a major performance improvement: when creating temporary streams in flatMap, for instance, there's no need to create a Dispatcher for everything.
- The `scope` decouples subscribers from EventStream/Property activation. This means that "cold observables" like `Bacon.once` cannot be EventStreams in Lonna. They will be `EventStreamSeeds` (what should I call it?) and can be used in constructs like `flatMap` as intermediary Observables.
- `get<A>(p: Property<A>):A` method for reliable synchronous access to current value. Also, a Property *always* has a value. This is possible because `scope` guarantees freshness.
- More flexible Property interface that makes it easy to create properties that, for instance, extract their current value from the DOM or other external synchrnous source. 
- Properties and Atoms always automatically skip duplicates, so no need for `.skipDuplicates` like in Bacon
- No Error events. I've found them quite counterproductive in my use cases. 
- Simpler dispatch system, no Atomic Updates. However, when decomposition using map/combine is stateless which in itself guarantees that composed/decomposed state remains in sync
- Atoms included for read-write state, similarly Bus for read-write streams. Rudimentary lens system included for decomposing state.
- API consists of static methods instead of prototype methods. Is tree-shakable and easier to extend.
- No global state, no `instanceof` checks => no problems even when running two Lonna instances in the same application (as long as there are no breaking changes between versions)
